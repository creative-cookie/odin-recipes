# Basic Recipe Website

## Overview
This basic recipe website was created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It utilizes the HTML and CSS knowledge gained from the course so far.

## Features
The website features basic web pages that are linked from the index.html page to the various recipe pages and back.

## What I Learned
While most of the information on HTML and CSS was not new to me, this project helped test my knowledge of Git, GitHub, and using the command line to manage the repo. I also learned how to write markdown to create this README file.
